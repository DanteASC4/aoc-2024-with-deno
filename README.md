If any!

### Day 2 

Part 2 had me scratching my head a bit, prob because of how I did my solution to part 1. Gonna move on for now.

### Day 4

Confused myself with the bit of the instructions that said "overlapping other words" and the example's first line showing "XXMAS", spent much longer than woulda been actually necessary ðŸ’€

Even though it was second try (minor logic error) I felt part 2 was easier, but that's probably because I over-complicated part 1 lol.
